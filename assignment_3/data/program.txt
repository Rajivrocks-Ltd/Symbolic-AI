#In the think step, your agent evaluates the program rules.
#It does so by doing inference on the union of the program rules (this file) and the belief base.
#The program rules define how and when actions need to be added to the intentions, goals need to be addopted and beliefs needs to be added or deleted
#Actions are defined by the operators +-*~_. See the assignment for an explanantion of these operators.
#The conditions of a rule are the preconditions, just like any other rule. The conclusion of the rule contains the action(s) and/or facts that can be derived with inference.
#Actions are not used during inference as new facts (i.e., they cannot unify with the knowledge base), 
#They are processed by the agent as new facts into the appropriate knowledge bases (beliefs, desires, intentions).
#The exception is the addition action, of which the predicate is added to the facts during inference.
#Add your program rules below:

currPos(X)&link(X,Y)&>_goto(X,Y)
keyAt(I,X)&currPos(X)&!keyInv(I)>_grab(X,I)
currPos(X)&lockedAt(K,X)&keyInv(K)>_open(X,K)

# Goals
currPos(X)&lockedAt(K,X)&!keyInv(K)>*keyInv(K)
keyInv(K)>*locked(K)
currPos(X)&link(X,Y)&!visited(Y)>*visited(Y)
